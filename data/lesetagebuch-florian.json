The Hamburg-based magazine Stern had spent millions to fetch them through one of their journalists who in turn received them from a dealer that managed to acquire them from East Germany. Except: None of this was true and honest. The Stern management had committed to the deal behind their editors' back, the journalist kept half the money for himself (and spent lavishly on Hitler memorabilia) and the dealer in fact did not acquire the \"diaries\", but obediently forged them one by one as more money kept pouring in.\r\n\r\nI couldn't stop reading. This story has everything and raises some interesting questions aside from the story itself: To what lengths do we go to deceive ourselves if we desire for something to be true? How easy do we calm our inquisitory and skeptic nature if an authority we trust has provided us with enough plausible explanations, even if they themselves have been deceived due to a series of mistakes and oversights?\r\n\r\nRobert Harris wrote this book in 1986, briefly after the whole story had collapsed. I do not know what additional information has come to light in the 30+ years since, so this book may in fact be a little out of date. Also, I would have wished for a little transparency on how Harris was able to reconstruct the series of events, down to individual conversations. If the book has shown me one thing, it is to be skeptical of someone's narration of events, as long as the source isn't validated completely. What remains is a little uncertainty as to which assumptions Harris had to make to be able to tell it in such a cohesive and compelling manner. In any case, a book well worth reading if the story interests you.","date":"2020-11-30","id":38938,"pinned":false,"private":false,"rating":4,"tags":["english","history","author_m"],"type":"finished","url":"/eintrag/38938","user":{"username":"florian"}},{"book":{"author":{"id":8601,"name":"Mike Brown","url":"/autor/mike-brown"},"id":18302,"pages":288,"title":"How I Killed Pluto and Why It Had It Coming","url":"/buch/how-i-killed-pluto-and-why-it-had-it-coming"},"book_type":"book","comment":"The story of astrophysicist Mike Brown whose calling it is to observe the skies, trying to find new objects in our solar system.

He highlights how these things are good examples that explain the formation of a collective identity. They are tied together under one overarching thesis: This German identity has been defined by four great traumas:\r\n1. 1618-1648: The Thirty Year's War \r\n2. 1806-ish: Napoleon's victory over Prussia; most distinctly Napoleon's entering and occupation of Berlin\r\n3. 1933-1945: The \"Third Reich\" and the Holocaust\r\n4. 1949-1990: The division of Germany in East and West.\r\n\r\nThis is a history book. But it isn't a book about _all_ of German history. MacGregor cherry-picks to tell the stories that best illustrate his main thesis.

Instead, it's compelling, interesting and even entertaining to read.\r\n\r\nI've highlighted much for further reading and can recommend this book to anyone who is interested in German history and who wants to understand how German identity has been and is being formed.\r\n","date":"2020-11-14","id":38752,"pinned":false,"private":false,"rating":5,"tags":["english","history","author_m"],"type":"finished","url":"/eintrag/38752","user":{"username":"florian"}},{"book":{"author":{"id":9801,"name":"Wes McKinney","url":"/autor/wes-mckinney"},"id":21080,"pages":452,"title":"Python for Data Analysis","url":"/buch/python-for-data-analysis"},"book_type":"book","comment":"A book about data analysis with Python using the popular Pandas library (de-facto standard for data wrangling), written by the creator of Pandas himself. Or as I like to call it: The Pandas Book.\r\n\r\nFirst of, don't get me wrong: The 3-star rating doesn't mean this is not a good book. It just wasn't written in a style that I would have personally preferred.\r\n\r\nPros:\r\n- Very extensive coverage of (almost) the complete Pandas API. I feel like I have seen (and tried) all major Pandas features now.\r\n- Many code examples to see features in action.\r\n- Excellent last chapter where the author goes through real-world data sets and shows how to explore and analyse data using Pandas features.\r\n\r\nCons:\r\n- Large majority of examples using dummy data (`foo` and `bar` and random numbers). While this shows the technical interface, it didn't help me grasp the application potential in many cases.\r\n- The structure made the book feel like official API documentation extended with a bit of prose. To be fair, the author made that clear in the preface, but the book had promised me a \"hands-on guide (...) packed with practical case studies\", and I only found that to be true in the last chapter.\r\n\r\nWhat helped me was having a group of friends to discuss the book. We read one chapter a week and shared our notebooks of playing around with Pandas and our own data sets. While I personally prefer a slightly different style of coding books, studying this one has helped tremendously in becoming more familiar and confident in using Pandas for my data science projects.\r\n","date":"2020-11-02","id":38674,"pinned":false,"private":false,"rating":3,"tags":["tech","english","coding","author_m"],"type":"finished","url":"/eintrag/38674","user":{"username":"florian"}},{"book":{"author":{"id":4662,"name":"J.L.

It's not exactly a personal finance book, but kind of. It's not exactly a book about the foundations of behavioural finance, but kind of.

He infamously was the chief rocket engineer in the Third Reich, and after 1945 lived in the USA, eventually becoming one of the leading managers behind the US space program.\r\n\r\nI learned a lot about the entrepreneurial rocket boom of the early 20th century, the development of the V-2 rocket, and the Saturn program. The book goes into a lot of detail, in some places maybe even too much so, but overall all of it seemed important to understand von Braun's life.\r\n\r\nSomething remains unresolved for me personally: *Really* understanding von Braun's role and responsibility in the crimes of the V-2 production and the treatment of KZ prisoners. There appears to be very little hard evidence to come to a clear judgement on these questions. I don't think this is a shortcoming of the biography. It's more the ambiguity of the character Wernher von Braun and his role and standing in the history of the world.\r\n\r\nA meticulous biography.

The subtitle reads \"How to get what you want by saying what you mean\", but in my mind \"getting what you want\" isn't at all what this book is about.\r\n\r\nAlso, after the first 1-2 chapters, I thought I had in my hands what is so common for many business books: One core idea (here: \"care personally, challenge directly\") being re-iterated over the course of an entire book.\r\n\r\nBut then, Kim Scott caught my attention. More and more anecdotes resonated with me, and I realized she lays out a full management philosophy, in addition to actionable things to try. In particular the second half of the book (\"Tools & Techniques\") helped me understand _how_ to apply her ideas.\r\n\r\nSome things I learned:\r\n\r\n- Ruinous empathy: Presented as a common attitude of (new) managers, I can relate: You don't want to _hurt_ the other person, so you avoid giving criticism altogether. Turns out: This doesn't help anyone and you are failing on a core responsibility: Giving meaningful guidance to people who want to improve.\r\n- Career Conversations: Life story; dreams; 18-months plan. A structure on how to have guiding conversations with the people on your team. Help understand values and put the current position of the person in perspective to their larger career and life vision.\r\n- Separate debate meetings from decision meetings, or at least be explicit about it. In addition, I think you could further separate the ideation phase, so that ideas aren't shot down early by (well intended) debates.\r\n\r\nI can't and won't apply everything that's in this book. Some aspects simply don't apply. \"Firing people\" as described in the book just isn't legal in Germany. Other things are in fact already implemented in one way or another in the agile practices we try to live in my current team.

Some central concepts are: \r\n\r\n- The dichotomy of control: Don\u2019t worry about things you have no influence on. \r\n- Virtues above pleasure: It is not bad to lead of good life of earthly delights, as long as you never betray your fundamental virtues.\r\n- Mindfulness and mental awareness: Plans don\u2019t work out perfectly; negative things happen - but you are still in control of how you react to these external influences and the curveballs life throws at you.\r\n\r\nI don\u2019t think the author explicitly mentions \u201chappiness\u201d all too much in the book, but to me, Stoicism is a tangible mindset to create happiness from within. Then again, \u201chappiness\u201d could also be a \u201cpreferred indifferent\u201d according to the stoic idea: Great if you have it, but not worth trading your virtues for. Hm.

Vicki Robin, who appears to be an interesting and caring woman living somewhere on an island in the US, shares her philosophy on... well money and life.\r\n\r\nIn her framework, money equates 'life energy'. Every dollar you spend was earned with a certain number of minutes of your life. One interesting method she presents is calculating your 'real hourly wage'. Basically, take your 'official' hourly wage, but subtract any costs you have that simply support you working in the first place, and account for the additional time you actually spend to support your job. Your _real_ hourly wage may be disappointingly low.\r\n\r\nIn some places, I couldn't completely follow the line of thought. Simply put, one chapter went something like this: \"Stop pretending your job is what fills you with purpose and joy, it's a lie constructed by society. Instead, become financially independent so that you don't need to work for money. Find your passion, and you may even turn that passion into something that earns money\". Okay... but then you are where you started, aren't you? You work to earn money and tell yourself that it's what you're passionate about. I don't know, but this bit confused me.\r\n\r\nStill, I really liked the book. She constructs a holistic approach to money and offers tools to find out if your money spending is is really aligned with your values. Vicki Robin is a sincere and warm voice in a space often occupied by mostly technical approaches to thinking about money. This is a classic for good reason.","date":"2020-04-27","id":36474,"pinned":false,"private":false,"rating":4,"tags":["english","finance","author_f"],"type":"finished","url":"/eintrag/36474","user":{"username":"florian"}},{"book":{"author":{"id":604,"name":"Paul Auster","url":"/autor/paul-auster"},"id":18145,"pages":203,"title":"City of Glass","url":"/buch/city-of-glass-2"},"book_type":"book","comment":"A short read.

Bought it despite its unfriendly cover (Nazi guy raising his right arm in the air...) and its old publish date (1989!). I'm really glad I did buy it, though.\r\n\r\nThe writing is far from being as shallow as the dramatic cover suggests. In fact, Callum MacDonald was a British professor of history who has sadly died from cancer in the 90s. While being well researched and reflective on many actors during the war, his writing is so clear and concise that it was hard to put this book down.\r\n\r\nA large part of the book is dedicated to telling the story of the fate of Czechoslovakia, a country which enjoyed a brief time of independence before basically being handed over to Nazi Germany in 1938 after France and England co-signed the Munich agreement. The Czech president Bene\u0161 went into exile in London, where he tried to support the Czech underground while lobbying with the Allies for more support of the Czech cause. Eventually, he was involved in sending \"Operation Anthropoid\" to Prague. Their mission: Kill Reinhard Heydrich, the \"butcher of Prague\" and highest ranking nazi who has ever been assassinated during WWII.\r\n\r\nWe also learn about the background of Heydrich, his early and quickly progressing career and his eventual posting to Prague.\r\n\r\nThe actual story of the assassination is told just as interestingly as the rest. If you are interested in that part of the story alone, go and watch \"Anthropoid\", a recent Hollywood movie which depicts the dramatic events very well, I think.\r\n\r\nOverall, one of my better impulse purchases.","date":"2019-09-08","id":33467,"pinned":false,"private":false,"rating":4,"tags":["english","history","author_m"],"type":"finished","url":"/eintrag/33467","user":{"username":"florian"}},{"book":{"author":{"id":8681,"name":"Martha Hall Kelly","url":"/autor/martha-hall-kelly"},"id":18464,"pages":496,"title":"Lilac Girls","url":"/buch/lilac-girls"},"book_type":"book","comment":"The story of three women throughout the 1930s and later.

I don't know. But this one, I did have to read. I am an avid fan of the budgeting software YNAB (You Need a Budget) and this book by their founder highlights the 4 principle of how he recommends you should organize your money.\r\n\r\n1. \"Give every dollar a job\". Explicitly put your money in categories. Food, gadgets, travel, what have you. These categories reflect your personal values. It's not about money, really. It's about what's important to you, now and for the future.\r\n2. \"Embrace your true expenses\". Larger, less frequent expenses like yearly insurance fees are often overlooked. Make them part of your \"jobs\" from rule no 1 so that no expense will ever surprise you. Instead, slowly save up to when that bill hits.\r\n3. \"Roll with the punches\". A good budget is designed to be changed, not to force you into a fixed set of rules. If your priorities change, be honest to yourself, and re-assign the jobs from rule no 1.\r\n4. \"Age your money\". When you're living paycheck to paycheck, money leaves your account soon after having arrived. This is a stress factor and not sustainable. Aim to extend that \"age\" of your money, at least for 30 days, preferably longer.\r\n\r\nI liked the content and also the tone of the book. Jesse is a friendly and humorous advisor, but also a good storyteller who shares the experience of managing a household with 6 kids and his family's approach to having healthy finances.\r\n\r\nPersonally, I have been working with the YNAB software for a year and they do have a lot of educational content online, so actually I didn't learn a lot that was new. Still, having everything told in this format felt nice and worth my time.\r\n\r\nUnclear to me still: How exactly would one implement this budgeting principle without YNAB or similar software? At the very least, probably you'd have an elaborate spreadsheet.

Spend less than you earn. Invest the rest. Ideally, you save and invest 50% or more of your income.\r\n2. Simply pour your savings in the cheapest and broadest stock market product there is. In the US, it's Vanguard's Total stock market index.\r\n\r\nThings that were not \"perfect\":\r\n\r\n- Very US-centric. A handful of chapters do not apply to people outside of the US, because he talks about tax-efficient retirement plans which we do not have in Germany.\r\n- Most reported yields used numbers that were taken from the optimistic end of the range of historic market returns. I wonder why. This strategy does not require any magic sauce to make the maths work. 5-8% of stock market returns are perfectly fine if you have your savings rate and spending habits in check.\r\n\r\nWhy I think this was great:\r\n\r\n- Target audience was JL Collins' daughter who does not care for finances. His language was clear, to the point and had a friendly tone.\r\n- A significant part of the book was supposed to teach you to \"not panic\". Stocks are risky only in the sense that they are volatile. Understand that crashes are part of the deal, and just invest calmly.\r\n- One chapter talked about the \"safe widthdrawel rate\": You can withdraw 4% per year from a stock portfolio and can (pretty much) live on it forever. I only knew this blog-compressed version of the rule, when in reality the original study goes in depth a lot more. The book even sported 4 full pages of numerical calculations. Loved it!

Reality is more nuanced than that, but I guess it's enough to make his point. \r\n\r\nOften 'his point' simply appears to be to rant about all traders (except himself) or all holders of an MBA (except for himself) or all people who have succeeded by chance (except, maybe, for himself?). Taleb tries really hard to sound like someone you wouldn't want to be around for too long. Not sure if that's actually true, or just a character he plays.\r\n\r\nTo finish positively, however, I like many of his conclusions.

FIRE stands for \"Financial Independence; Retire Early\" and is the concept of spending less than you earn, putting the difference in simple investment products until you reach a point in life where your expenses are completely covered by the income from your investments. As a rule of thumb, this amount is about 25 times the total number of your annual expenses. When you reach this point is a simple calculation based only on your savings rate: How many percent of your income are you able to stash away instead of spending. So if you save 16%, you can retire in 34 years. At a savings rate of 58%, the time shrinks to only 11 years.\r\n\r\nBased on these concepts, the author and his girlfriend take us on their 1-year journey from learning about FIRE to completely changing their lifestyle. They reference many of the central figures in this movement, be it by personal conversation or a link to their blog or podcast.\r\n\r\nI found this book very captivating. Most of the central concepts were not new to me, but following someone on their actual path felt very authentic.\r\n\r\nI have learned even more that FIRE can take many forms. Yes, you can be frugal as hell and only eat rice and noodles, but there are a lot of alternative and effective ways of decreasing expenses. The central idea is often summed up as 'optimising for happiness' with the optimisation considering of short- and long-term effects. Overall, it also means a more sustainable and environment-friendly way of consuming resources.\r\n\r\nAlso, the term 'retirement' is clearly not meant in the traditional way of simply not working. Instead, it means the general independence of a paycheque-based employment, offering freedom to work on passion projects without financial worries, traveling or in general just doing what makes you happy.\r\n\r\nNow, will I go FIRE?

Nicht nur cringy, auch unpassend. Es geht null um ein \"get rich scheme\". Was haben die sich im Verlag denn da gedacht, ey. Immerhin ein h\u00fcbsches Cover.\r\n\r\nWorum geht es hier dann? Kurz zur Autorin: Susan Levermann war Fondsmanagerin bei der DWS, dem gr\u00f6\u00dften Fondshaus in Deutschland  \u2014 und mit ihren Fonds laufend au\u00dfergew\u00f6hnlich erfolgreich. 2009 entscheidet sie sich aber, aus der Finanzwelt auszusteigen und als Lehrerin zu arbeiten. Diese Backstory hat mein Interesse geweckt. Und generell ist die nach ihr benannte \"Levermann Strategie\" mittlerweile ziemlich bekannt und viele wenden sie an. Also muss man das doch mal lesen, dachte ich mir!\r\n\r\nIn diesem Buch dokumentiert sie ihre verwendete Strategie zur Aktienauswahl. Generell startet sie mit einer Erkl\u00e4rung, wie Firmen finanziell funktionieren. Da habe ich schon viel gelernt! Wie liest man eine Gewinn- und Verlustrechnung, wie die Bilanz eines Unternehmens, sowas.\r\n\r\nDann berichtet sie \u00fcber die B\u00f6rse und systematische Fehler, die Menschen dort begehen. Hiermit leitet sie die Kriterien her, die sie dann als eine Checkliste zum systematischen Durchgehen zusammenfasst,  um zur Einsch\u00e4tzung eines Unternehmens zu kommen. Diese Art des Investierens bezeichnet sie als \u201cquantitatives\u201d Investieren. Klingt plausibel, auch wenn das \"passive\" Investieren auf mich bisher immer am rationalsten erschien.\r\n\r\nAbschlie\u00dfend widmet Susan Levermann sich der Frage nach der Ethik des Anlegens an der B\u00f6rse \u00fcberhaupt. Zwar entkr\u00e4ftigt sie viele typische Vorw\u00fcrfe, nennt aber etwa Leerverk\u00e4ufe unethisch. Sie kommt insgesamt zu dem Urteil, dass selbst bei finanziell neutralem Marktgeschehen (alle Gewinne und Verluste gleichen sich aus), es dennoch emotional zu einem insgesamt negativen Ergebnis f\u00fcr die Marktteilnehmer kommt. Ein Verlust werde deutlich negativer empfunden als ein gleichwertiger Gewinn. Auch wenn sie es nicht abschlie\u00dfend explizit so formuliert, scheint dies der Grund zu sein, dass sie selbst sich dem B\u00f6rsengeschehen abgewandt hat.\r\n\r\nRein faktisch habe ich hier viel mitgenommen. Zwar str\u00e4ubt sich in mir einiges, da ich von Kommer, Malkiel und Co eigentlich sehr dahingehend indoktriniert bin, dass aktives Investieren nicht funktionieren kann. Susan Levermann argumentiert sehr plausibel, dass es doch geht und auch sie beruft sich auf diverse Studien. Tja, ich wei\u00df noch nicht so richtig.\r\n\r\nSehr hatte ich mich auf ihre Abw\u00e4gungen zu Moral und Ethik gefreut. Genau da fand ich es dann doch teilweise etwas unbefriedigend. Hier und da gab es auch etwas zu viel spirituelle Andeutungen und christliche Zitate f\u00fcr meinen Geschmack, aber es hielt sich noch im im Rahmen.\r\n","date":"2019-02-05","id":30153,"pinned":false,"private":false,"rating":4,"tags":["finance","german","author_f"],"type":"finished","url":"/eintrag/30153","user":{"username":"florian"}},{"book":{"author":{"id":6547,"name":"Hans Rosling, Anna Rosling R\u00f6nnlund & Ola Rosling","url":"/autor/hans-rosling-anna-rosling-roennlund-ola-rosling"},"id":16076,"pages":350,"title":"Factfulness","url":"/buch/factfulness-2"},"book_type":"book","comment":"For months I have wanted to read this book and in January I finally got around to it. Hans Rosling and his co-authors present an intriguing guideline to form a fact-based worldview. In their book, they educate about the actual state the world is in -- and it's dramatically better than what most people think. In addition, they teach about the instincts we use to _wrongly_ think about the world.\r\n\r\nIn a world where news, social media, others around us (myself included) talk about anecdotal evidence most of the time rather than always knowing the _actual_ proportions of current problems, this book is an amazing guideline. It might become my new go-to reference that I think I will re-read every once in a while. I can whole heartedly recommend this book to everyone.\r\n\r\nI do have one nit-pick, though: At one point, they report the fact that tigers, giant pandas and black rhinos are now not more endangered than they were in the 1990s. While this is an encouraging anecdote, here they make the same mistake they want to teach the reader not to make. Why pick 3 examples from the whole data, while the overall state of wild life seems to be getting worse and worse? According to [a WWF report](https://www.worldwildlife.org/pages/living-planet-report-2016), for a lot of species, the populations have drastically decreased in the last 40 years. Maybe the book has already taught me how to questions these factoids before judging the whole, but they could have also picked a more representative data set, I think.\r\n\r\nNonetheless, wow, what a great view of the world. Realistic, yet optimistic (he calls himself a \"possibilist\", I like that).\r\n\r\nHaving seen some of Hans Rosling's talks online years ago, then learning about his death after that, and now seeing this book as a summary of his life's work really moved me. I think this is a must read.","date":"2019-01-30","id":30034,"pinned":false,"private":false,"rating":5,"tags":["english","science","author_d"],"type":"finished","url":"/eintrag/30034","user":{"username":"florian"}},{"book":{"author":{"id":5248,"name":"Ulrike Herrmann","url":"/autor/ulrike-herrmann"},"id":16463,"pages":288,"title":"Der Sieg des Kapitals","url":"/buch/der-sieg-des-kapitals"},"book_type":"book","comment":"Neben all den _pers\u00f6nlichen_ Finanzb\u00fcchern der letzten Monate wollte ich mal etwas wirtschaftliches aus anderer Sicht lesen. Durch Zufall fand ich in einem Laden dieses Buch, das sowohl von der Geschichte des Kapitalismus, als auch von diversen Volkswirtschaftlichen Themen allgemein berichtet. Zudem ist Ulrike Hermann Wirtschaftsredakteurin der taz, hat also naturgem\u00e4\u00df eine eher links gef\u00e4rbte Sicht. Klang vielversprechend!\r\n\r\nSehr spannend f\u00fcr mich: Endlich mal gesamtwirtschaftliche Betrachtungen, nicht nur \"was ist finanziell das beste f\u00fcr mich pers\u00f6nlich\". So wird sie auch nicht m\u00fcde zu betonen, dass volkswirtschaftliche Probleme nicht durch betriebswirtschaftliche Ans\u00e4tze gel\u00f6st werden k\u00f6nnen, da Staat und Betrieb nicht gleich funktionieren. Beispiel: Einem wirtschaftlich angeschlagenen Betrieb tut ein Sparkurs gut, um Ausgaben zu senken. Eine Volkswirtschaft driftet in einer Rezession durch weiteres Sparen aber noch weiter in die Krise: Die Menschen haben wenig Geld, dadurch wird weniger gekauft, dadurch sinken die Preise, dadurch wird weniger Umsatz gemacht, dadurch bekommen die Menschen noch weniger Geld. Stattdessen hilft ein Investitionsprogramm, wie zum Beispiel der \"New Deal\" von Roosevelt als Antwort auf die Weltwirtschaftskrise. \r\n\r\nSolche Zusammenh\u00e4nge erkl\u00e4rt sie aus meiner noch unbelesenen Sicht gro\u00dfteils plausibel, klingt hier und da aber schon sehr kritisch und sagt manchmal nur Dinge wie \"dies haben die Neoliberalen nie verstanden\" wo dann manchmal eine konkrete Begr\u00fcndung fehlt.\r\n\r\nIch versuche momentan f\u00fcr mich pers\u00f6nlich herauszufinden, ob es einen \"gesunden Kapitalismus\" gibt, und da hilft mir ihr Buch auf jeden Fall. Ulrike Hermann geht n\u00e4mlich nicht den _einfachen_ Weg zu sagen, dass Kapitalismus allgemein ein ungerechtes System sei, sondern zeigt faktisch, welche Gr\u00fcnde zum Entstehen unseres heutigen Systems gef\u00fchrt haben, wo oft falsch berichtet wird (z.B. belegt sie glaubhaft, dass unsere Wirtschaft gro\u00dfteils keine Marktwirtschaft ist), und welche Rahmenbedingungen zu einem gerechteren Kapitalismus f\u00fchren (w\u00fcrden). Letzten Endes gibt sie einen Ausblick auf die \"Endlichkeit des Wachstums\", bleibt aber eine abschlie\u00dfende Bewertung, ob der Kapitalismus an sich nun \"schlecht\" ist, schuldig. \r\n\r\nDa muss ich wohl noch ein bisschen mehr lesen, bin nach diesem Buch aber prinzipiell optimistisch gestimmt, das nicht _alles_ schlecht ist, sondern ein Kapitalismus mit staatlich gesetzten Rahmenrichtlinien ein gerechtes System sein k\u00f6nnte.","date":"2019-01-29","id":30018,"pinned":false,"private":false,"rating":4,"tags":["finance","german","history","author_f"],"type":"finished","url":"/eintrag/30018","user":{"username":"florian"}},{"book":{"author":{"id":4,"name":"Jonathan Safran Foer","url":"/autor/jonathan-safran-foer"},"id":3852,"pages":288,"title":"Everything Is Illuminated","url":"/buch/everything-is-illuminated"},"book_type":"book","comment":"Another one by Jonathan Safran Foer -- who writes in such a unique way, it is both a pleasure to read, but sometimes also challenging to stay fully engaged. \r\n\r\nWe follow two narrators, the young Ukrainian Alex, and our hero, the fictional (?) Jonathan Safran Foer himself, on a journey through Ukraine's countryside, trying to track down pieces from the past, from the 1940s, when terrible things happened here. Both their families somehow survived the war, and their paths seem very much entangled. The story is told by telling multiple stories at ones. From the early jewish Shtetl in the 18th century, over multiple generations of ancestors with their loves, affairs and other secrets.\r\n\r\nThe writing seems to follow a branched network of thoughts, a depth-first search through a mind map gathered over generations. Sometimes, it was hard to follow for me, but then we backtracked to a level where I could fully enjoy the story again.\r\n\r\nOverall, I think this is another great book of his.

Still, it wasn't for me personally.\r\n\r\nThe premise of the book is the huge amount of early-earth-creationists. The actual numbers of people believing in a world younger than 10,000 years baffles me (about 45% in the US, less in Europe, more in Islamic countries). In my surrounding though, I haven't met a single person who wouldn't believe in a million year history of evolution. \r\n\r\nDawkins really wants to drive the point home that evolution is a fact, so the books tends to get very repetitive in places. For some facts he gives three and more examples, stretching over several pages, where a simple \"this is how it is, and here is a 2 sentence example\" would have sufficed.\r\n\r\nFrom the explictit overstating of examples and repetition of already mentioned facts I would have thought this to be targeted at ... less educated people? At the same time, Dawkins uses quite educated language. His sentences have this intellectual ring to them. It's as if you are hearing his British voice in your head.\r\n\r\nThe actual facts and pieces of evidence he presents are very interesting. Still, I am sure the same could have been done in a third of the book's volume.\r\n\r\nThis is a book offering ammunition to people who are surrounded by history deniers.

The premise of the book however sounds a bit strange to me, as it seems to be trying to tell the reader what to do to be like Steve Jobs without questioning his actions. Also the writing is a bit out of date of course, as it was written a few years before Jobs' passing away. He certainly was an inspiring person and this book seems to give a good introduction to his role at Apple (and Pixar), but to have a more profound image about his life I think I'll read more from different sources.
